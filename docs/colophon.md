Argo Links was originally developed by NPR as part of [Project Argo](http://argoproject.org/argo-links.php), WordPress theme that would allow 12 NPR member stations to "curate and report on news about specific topics of local interest." Development was funded by grants grants from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the Knight Foundation.
