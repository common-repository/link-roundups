# Troubleshooting

## When I click on the title of a link roundup from my home page, I get a broken link (404 page)

Go to Settings > Permalinks page in your WordPress dashboard and click the "save changes" button. Clicking the "save changes" button flushes WordPress' rewrite rules and fixes permalinks for custom post types.
